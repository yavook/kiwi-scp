# kiwi-config

The simple tool for managing container servers

## Quick start

- Learn to use `docker` with `docker-compose`
- Install kiwi-config
- Look at [the example instance](../example)
- Look at the output of `kiwi --help`
- Start building your own instances

## Installation

```shell script
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldericher/kiwi-config/master/install.sh' | sh
```

That script checks for the basic dependencies of the `kiwi` command, then downloads the main script and installs it to a location of your choice. Please consider installing `kiwi` into a directory inside your $PATH.
